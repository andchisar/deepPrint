# DeepPrint

**DeepPrint** is an open-source initiative dedicated to advancing 3D printing through thoughtful design, scientific rigor, and community collaboration.

At its core, DeepPrint offers a growing library of **3D printer configurations**, **custom components**, and **designs**‚Äîeach accompanied by detailed explanations of the engineering decisions behind them. Every design is supported by **scientific references**, technical articles, and experimental data, allowing users to explore the "why" behind each choice and deepen their understanding of additive manufacturing.

Whether you are a hobbyist, researcher, or professional, DeepPrint empowers you to:

- üõ†Ô∏è **Build smarter**: Use proven configurations and modular designs optimized for performance, reliability, and flexibility.
- üìö **Learn deeply**: Access curated documentation that clearly explains mechanical, thermal, and material considerations.
- üî¨ **Explore evidence**: Dive into linked studies, simulations, and benchmarks that validate design choices.
- üîÑ **Modify freely**: All files, schematics, and documentation are released under permissive open-source licenses, encouraging remixing, improvement, and redistribution.

DeepPrint is not just a repository‚Äîit is a platform for **transparent engineering** and **collaborative innovation**. Contributions are welcome from designers, scientists, and makers who value openness and precision.

## Key Features

- Parametric CAD models created with FreeCAD, so anyone can open and modify the original files
- Printable parts with tested tolerances
- Configuration files for firmware and slicers
- Annotated schematics and BOMs
- Scientific references and design rationales
- Modular architecture for easy customization

## Philosophy

We believe that open source is a powerful way to deepen knowledge. It is essential that anyone can understand the physical phenomena, verify them, discuss them, and modify the designs. The keywords to keep in mind are **understandable**, **verifiable**, and **shareable**. DeepPrint aims to be a source of knowledge‚Äînot just another black-box product to buy.

## Contributing

DeepPrint thrives on community involvement and collaboration. There are several ways you can contribute to this initiative:

- **Active Participation**: Join our community discussions, provide feedback on designs, and contribute your own insights and experiences. Your input helps refine our offerings and enhances the collective knowledge base.

- **Active Contribution**: Engage with the various projects within this repository, including the development of tools like FreeCAD. Your participation in enhancing these tools not only supports the open-source community but also the projects that use them, like DeepPrint.

- **Financial Support**: Consider contributing financially to help us acquire materials for experimentation and further development. Your support enables us to explore new ideas and expand our library of resources.

Every contribution, no matter how small, helps us build a richer, more robust platform for everyone interested in 3D printing and additive manufacturing.
